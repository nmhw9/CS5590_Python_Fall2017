Legend and obfuscation cloud his work, so it is uncertain whether he truly contributed much to mathematics
or natural philosophy. Many of the accomplishments credited to Pythagoras may actually have been accomplishments
of his colleagues or successors. Some accounts mention that the philosophy associated with Pythagoras was related
to mathematics and that numbers were important. It was said that he was the first man to call himself a philosopher,
or lover of wisdom, and Pythagorean ideas exercised a marked influence on Plato, and through him, all of Western
philosophy.
Much of what we know about Pythagoras's life comes from Neoplatonist writers. These writers believed in the Greek gods,
so many myths exist around Pythagoras. Myths about Pythagoras include: Apollo was his father, Pythagoras gleamed
with a supernatural brightness, Pythagoras had a golden thigh, Abaris once flew to him on a golden arrow, and
Pythagoras was seen in different places at the same time. According to Sir William Smith, with the exception of a
few remarks by Xenophanes, Heraclitus, Herodotus, Plato, Aristotle, and Isocrates, we are mainly dependent on
Diogenes LaÃ«rtius, Porphyry, and Iamblichus for biographical details.Burkert states that Aristoxenus
and Dicaearchus are the most important accounts.

The boy's name was Santiago. Dusk was falling as the boy arrived with his
herd at an abandoned church. The roof had fallen in long ago, and an
enormous sycamore had grown on the spot where the sacristy had once
stood.
He decided to spend the night there. He saw to it that all the sheep entered
through the ruined gate, and then laid some planks across it to prevent the
flock from wandering away during the night. There were no wolves in the
region, but once an animal had strayed during the night, and the boy had
had to spend the entire next day searching for it.
He swept the floor with his jacket and lay down, using the book he had just
finished reading as a pillow. He told himself that he would have to start
reading thicker books: they lasted longer, and made more comfortable
pillows.
